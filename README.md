# DP-LLM
Saad's crash course to LLM training with Differential Privacy enabled gradient optimizers.



## Plan so far:
- [ ] Get ChatGPT to generate fake data for prelim. testing.
  - [ ] Define the labels. 
  - [ ] Define the prompt for limiting the scope of chatGPT responses.
  - [ ] Get the final csv file
- [ ] Get the base distillGPT2 trained (reproduce the online examples).
  - [ ] Find an appropriate example online. 
  - [ ] Reproduce the example locally. 
  - [ ] Experiment as needed.  
- [ ] Attach privacy engine.
  - [ ] Use the newly released private transformers library to enable fine-tuning with DP.
